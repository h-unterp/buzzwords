# Find all buzzwords in your resume and all it's missing.

## See project here: https://h-unterp.github.io/buzzwords/ 

## UX ideas:
1. 2nd "page" to show results, back button to go back to start.
2. Highlighting of buzzwords on resume.
3. Cookies to save state.
4. Ability to add/remove individual buzzwords
5. Accept PDF and transform to plaintext

## Areas for improvement:

1. Statistical analysis (frequency/importance)
2. partial word matches
3. Document corpus (crowdsource/web crawler/API/Partnership) from which to derive buzzwords. 

## Document Corpus Ideas
  * MVP should be crowdsource model (users able to submit job descriptions via form)
  * Need algorithm to parse out keywords
  * Need datastore to save, rank (by frequency) keywords
