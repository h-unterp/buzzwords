# Given a list of buzzwords and a resume find all the buzzwords that your resume contains, and all buzzwords it is missing.


## example usage: 
``` python buzz.txt res.txt
buzz.txt is a new-line delimited list of buzzwords
res.txt is your resume (don't worry about formatting, just copy/paste it from pdf to a txt file).
```

## UX ideas:
1. Web UI
2. Cookies to save state.
3. Ability to add/remove individual buzzwords
4. Accept PDF and transform to plaintext

## Areas for improvement:

1. Statistical analysis (frequency/importance)
2. ensure capitalization is handled
3. partial word matches
4. Document corpus (crowdsource/web crawler/API/Partnership) from which to derive buzzwords.
